      <h3> My Vision </h3>
      <br>
      <p>   
            'I am currently a third-year Undergraduate Student at Texas A&M University 
            and am pursuing a bachelor's in Computer Science with an emphasis in Mathematics! I am 
            on the lookout for a Summer 2024 internship, job, or any other opportunity to gain experience
            in the industry as well as figure out what I am (and am not) interested. Long term, I am still figuring out exactly which avenue in Computer 
            Science I would like to pursue but am sure I would like to finish my career in a place 
            where I feel like I am directly helping others. As I've started the back half of my college career, 
            I have begun to feel an even greater excitement for my field and am eager to enter the industry! Thanks and gig 'em!'

      <h3> More About Me </h3>
      <br>
      <p>  My hometown is Trophy Club, Texas (just outside of Dallas) and although I've moved a couple of times, I have lived in the 
        Dallas area all of my life. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my friends, working out, as well as playing video games 
        and soccer. Although high school computer science classes inspired me in the pursuit of the study, I've always enjoyed all sorts 
        of sciences and subjects and enjoy lightly educating myself on the subjects outside of class- whether that be by reading or YouTube. 
        I really enjoy reading about Psychology, Philosophy, and physics in particular (some of the books I've really enjoyed are to the left). I enjoy Computer Science because I really enjoy the 
        process of creating and understanding things on a technical level, in fact Prior to wanting to major in Computer Science I had wanted 
        to become a Chemical Engineer for a long time- I believe the two have a parallel in their seemingly limitlessly abilities to create in 
        the physical and virtual world. While the study is laborious I am super excited for my junior year as I am starting to get the opportunity to 
        utilize more creativity in my courses.
